# Data Engineering Assignment - End-to-End Data Pipeline
# Project Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end data engineering project that extracts data from an API source, models the data to fit a desired schema, and culminates in a visual representation using PowerBI.

The objective of this project was to simulate the workflow of a Data Engineer, demonstrating the capability to source, transform, model, and present data.

# API Data Extraction
The project begins by sourcing data from an API. Details about the API, the data it provides, and the extraction process are documented in the respective module.

# Data Modeling
Once data is extracted, it undergoes a transformation and modeling process to fit into our desired schema. This involves cleaning, filtering, and restructuring the data to be efficiently stored and queried.

# Data Visualization in PowerBI
The modeled data is then used as a source for our PowerBI dashboard. Here, we visualize the data, revealing patterns, insights, and actionable intel.

# Presentation
Embedded within the PowerBI dashboard is a presentation that details the methodology, solutions implemented, and the insights derived from the data.
